abstract ={While the ambitious goal of completion of the single European energy market was not reached by 2014, overall European market integration has advanced further than ever, with competition law having played an important role in the process.National competition authorities have become the main drivers of the enforcement of competition law in the energy sector, with the Commission not opening a case for the first time since 2005â€”even though there are still major ongoing investigations in Brussels and the new Commissioner for Competition stating that the energy sector will remain a focus of DG Competition's work.},
